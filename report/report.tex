%In addition, you should write one or two pages discussing your experiments in more depth. The discussion should reflect what you have learned from this assignment and might address the following topics.

%* What minimmum spanning tree algorithm did you use, and why?
%* What is the running time of your algorithm?
%* If you chose to throw away edges, how did you determine `k(n)`, and how effective was this approach?
%* Can you give a rought explanation for your results? (The limiting behaviour as `n` grows large can be proven rigorously, but it is very difficult; you need not attempt to prove any exact result.)
%* Did you have any interesting experiences with the random number generator? Do you trust it?
